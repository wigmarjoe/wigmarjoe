## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m Joe â€” full-time Software Engineer, part-time bug collector.
â˜• Powered by coffee, sarcasm, and way too many console.logs.

Outside of code, youâ€™ll probably find me watching TV shows, hanging out with friends, 
or messing around with new tech ideas. I also enjoy learning languages and planning my next big move abroad.
